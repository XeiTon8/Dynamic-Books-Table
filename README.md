## ðŸŒ  Motivation

This project helped me to improve my skills for configuring WebPack and Babel for React app without using create-react-app boilerplate. Also I improved my searching skill â€” by creating this project, I've learned more how to quickly find information about something (e.g. Google Books API) and implement it into the project.
